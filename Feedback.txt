Missing javadocs for everything besides the start of the file in Player and DiscardPile
Need to check that obj is a Card before converting
don't need an if statement for the final check of it, can just return the condition.
reshuffle should take a Card[] to reshuffle.
DiscardPile is missing removeAll and toString
Player card missing almost everything
